As an **Author**, I want to create, edit, and collaborate on articles in real-time with version control, so that I can work efficiently with others without losing track of changes or overwriting their work.

As an **Editor**, I want to review, approve, and manage articles, so that only high-quality and accurate content is published for readers.

As a **Viewer**, I want to read articles and explore their version history, so that I can understand how the content has evolved and access previous versions if needed.

As an **Admin**, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control who can create, edit, approve, or view content, ensuring the system remains secure and organized.
